# [deej](https://github.com/omriharel/deej) volume mixer with leds
This is my version of the deej volume mixer with 6 sliders and led feedback
Each slider has 6 leds assigned to it to show the approximate volume of the slider.

I used SK6812-mini E leds as they are reverse mount.
I also used a xiao rp2040
