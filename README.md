# [deej](https://github.com/omriharel/deej) volume mixer with leds
This is my version of the deej volume mixer with 6 sliders and led feedback
Each slider has 6 leds assigned to it to show the approximate volume of the slider.

I printed the top case out of a glow in the dark plastic to see the leds.
